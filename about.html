        <p>Piezoelectric materials such as lead zirconate titanate 
(PZT) are becoming the preferred choice of actuation of 
MEMS devices due to several advantages such as low drive 
voltage, high actuation forces and strain sensing due to 
direct piezo effect [12]. Table 1 summarizes the previous 
work on dual axis piezo based micro mirror and compares 
them by piezoelectric material, deposition method, 
excitation voltage, optical scan angle and working 
frequencies</p>
