            <p>In this paper, we report the design, microfabrication 
and characterizations of a dual-axis MEMS mirror based 
on an unconventional Ba-doped PZT piezo thin-film 
produced using pulsed laser deposition. The mirror features 
three resonant modes: one low frequency bending mode at 
490 Hz and two high frequency torsional modes at 9 kHz 
and 25 kHz both excited with a dog-bone shaped actuator. 
Excited at 2Vpp and 5Vpp, the optical scan angle of 15.5° 
and 6° was measured for slow and fast axis respectively. 
We show that the obtained results are comparable to the 
state-of-the art using classical sol-gel deposition, 
demonstrating high potential of using pulsed laser 
deposition for PZT MEMS devices</p>
            <p>Piezoelectric materials such as lead zirconate titanate 
(PZT) are becoming the preferred choice of actuation of 
MEMS devices due to several advantages such as low drive 
voltage, high actuation forces and strain sensing due to 
direct piezo effect [12]. Table 1 summarizes the previous 
work on dual axis piezo based micro mirror and compares 
them by piezoelectric material, deposition method, 
excitation voltage, optical scan angle and working 
frequencies</p>
            <p>Evidently, previous works rely almost 
exclusively on the lead zirconium titanate (PZT) deposited 
using sol-gel method. Sol-gel is a versatile technique for 
material development and usually higher piezoelectric 
coefficients are observed in the literature due to the large 
know-how build-up over the recent years</p>
